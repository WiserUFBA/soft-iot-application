# soft-iot-application

SOFT-IoT platform composes of a set of features that enable the implementation of Microservices for the construction of IoT applications. SOFT-IoT allows to create the following computational architectures: only networks of personal area sensors; personal area sensor network combined with gateway management, thus creating a local area network; network of personal area sensors with gateways and servers, thus creating a more robust local area network infrastructure; only Cloud Servers managing local devices; deployment of all infrastructure from the global network to the personal area network. Thus, the SOFT-IoT architecture is flexible and configurable to meet specific or generic infrastructure and application requirements.


## SOFT-IoT Microservices


### soft-iot-mapping-devices
This module is responsible for mapping devices connected with each FoT-Gateway. It is used by other modules to get access of basic information about devices and yours sensors/actuators.
